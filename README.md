# Turtle Crossing
Game written in python. 

The purpose is to get the turtle over the road without getting hit by a car.

In this simple version of the game you simple move up across the screen with ARROW UP and avoid the colored blocks flying across the screen coming from the right.

For each time you successfully cross, the cars move faster.

When it is GAME OVER, you can close the window with mouse button LEFT CLICK.
